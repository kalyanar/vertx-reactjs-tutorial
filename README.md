# Vert.x Example ReactJS Project

This was from the Vert.x template project and can be built with Maven.

It is an adaptation of the ReactJS [tutorial project](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html)
that is adapted to work with a Vert.x (in Ruby) backend.

It may not be very good.

The meat of the project is in

src/main/resources/web_server_verticle.rb

and

src/main/resources/web/index.html

It can be run with

```
mvn package vertx:runMod
```
